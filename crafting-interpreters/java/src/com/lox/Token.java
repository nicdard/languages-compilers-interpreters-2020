/*
 * Tips: Some token implementations store the location as two numbers: the offset from the beginning of the source
 * file to the beginning of the lexeme, and the length of the lexeme. The scanner needs to know these anyway, so
 * there’s no overhead to calculate them.
 *
 * An offset can be converted to line and column positions later by looking back at the source file and counting the
 * preceding newlines. That sounds slow, and it is. However, you only need to do it when you need to actually display
 * a line and column to the user. Most tokens never appear in an error message. For those, the less time you spend
 * calculating position information ahead of time, the better.
 */

/*
 * Tokens are not entirely homogeneous either. Tokens for literals store the value but other kinds of lexemes don’t
 * need that state. I have seen scanners that use different classes for literals and other kinds of lexemes, but I
 * figured I’d keep things simpler.
